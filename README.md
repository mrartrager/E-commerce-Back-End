  ## Description
  Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  ## Installation 
  make sure to install express, mysql2 and sequelize 

  ## Usage 
  to use this app, it is strongly suggested to have Insomnia and workbench installed on your system. 

  Insomnia is used for showing the actual functionality of the program (get, put, delete)

  Workbench is showing the updated tables after each put and delete and showing where they stand with a get. 

  to start the server: npm run start

  to start nodemon: npm run watch


  Here is a video link demonstrating the functionality of the program:
